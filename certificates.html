                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming lanuage is the lanuage of expressiong all digital stuffs we can do now a days.
                    Without a language no communication can be done with the computer.Learning Python language is necessary to deal with AI,ML and Data Science.
                    Thanks to Alexis Cook and thanks to kaggle for this appreciation.

                <a href="https://olympus1.mygreatlearning.com/course_certificate/STZSQZRY">Data Structures in C</a>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing a good data structure for a good algorithm is necessary.
                    That help's to boost algorithm's performance.In this course I learn how to efficiently use data structures
                    on various algorithms depending upon performancemeasures.

                <a href="https://olympus1.mygreatlearning.com/course_certificate/SZOUDKNM">Python for Machine Learning</a>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine Learning and AI are now a days requirement.Python provides us 
                    a better interface to implement ML&AI related problems in easier way,handle complex data efficiently.
                    And that's what I learn in this course.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Science has become an essential tool for now a days software products that used AI,ML.
                    Learning about data science through Pandas module of python with Kaggle was a great journey for me.Thanks to Aleksey Bilogur and 
                    Alexis Cook for this appreciation.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Science has become an essential tool for now a days software products that used AI,ML. Visualization 
                    of data make it so understandable and cleaning of data becomes pretty interesting.Thanks to Alexis Cook for this wonderful appreciation.
